About Click
Click is the BBC’s flagship technology programme. We’re on both TV and radio – across five BBC channels – and can be found on many social networks and iPlayer. The simplest way we’ve worked out to describe what we do is “the best debate on global technology, social media and the internet,” or “your guide to all the latest gadgets, websites, games and computer industry news”. But we just hope that you can join us.
